# Timelens

**Timelens** creates visual timelines from video files. For a general introduction, please visit <https://timelens.blinry.org>.

## Building from source

Timelens is written in the Rust programming language, so you'll need a working [Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org). You'll probably want to run these commands:

    $ curl -f https://sh.rustup.rs > rust.sh
    $ sh rust.sh
    $ source ~/.cargo/env

Then, compiling Timelens is as easy as this:

    $ git clone https://github.com/timelens/timelens
    $ cd timelens
    $ cargo build --release

This will create the binary `target/release/timelens`:

    $ ./target/release/timelens my_favorite_movie.mp4

To run the test suite, run `cargo test`.
